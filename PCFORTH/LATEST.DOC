Notes to users


The file directory on the full screen editor can be toggled on and off
with the "F" command on the main editing menu.  This is not documented
in the manual.



The  following  minor deviations from the 83-Standard  have  been 
reported.

     WORD  doesn't set >IN as specified by the Standard,  in  the 
     case where the input stream is exhausted.   Also, the format 
     of  the null byte brought to HERE when the input  stream  is 
     empty  is incorrect.  Neither of these problems will  affect 
     normal application software.

     QUIT  displays an "ok" on the standard output,  whereas  the 
     Standard specifies that QUIT shouldn't print anything.

Until  further notice,  LMI will pay $10.00 for each report of  a 
newly discovered bug or deviation from the 83-Standard.

Version  2.1  of PC/FORTH is currently in beta-test and  will  be 
released in July.   In that version all reported deviations  from 
the  Standard  will be fixed and several new capabilities  added, 
including:   full  support  for  the  "low-resolution"  16  color 
graphics  mode  including text output,  the  ability  to  compile 
source  programs  from  normal text files  or  Wordstar  document 
files,  and  a new bit-mapped binary overlay loader that can also 
handle CODE definitions. Warning: in order to make the new loader 
work, the implementation of DOES> will be slightly modified; this 
will not affect Standard application programs.   The stacks,  and 
disk  buffers will be moved to a separate segment to  allow  more 
dictionary workspace.
